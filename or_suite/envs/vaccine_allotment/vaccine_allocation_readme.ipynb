    "# The Vaccine Allocation Problem\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a limited number of available vaccines and a population undergoing an epidemic, how do we distribute vaccines to the population in a way that achieves some goal (like minimizing death or maximizing the potential for herd immunity)? The vaccine allocation or allotment problem considers the question: If we divide the population into different groups or risk classes, is there an *optimal* way to allocate the vaccines across these groups so that we minimize infections, deaths or hospitalizations? We approach this problem from a reinforcement learning perspective. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4 Groups with Finite Action and Finite State Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `vacc_alloc_4groups.py` contains an implemenation of an RL environment for the vaccine allotment problem with 4 possible risk groups, a finite action space, and a finite state space. In this problem, we consider a scenario where the agent chooses a *priority order* of the 4 risk groups. This means that vaccines are allocated in a particular order until there are no more vaccines. In other words, vaccines are given to eligbile recipients of priority group \\#1 until there are no eligible recipients left or the vaccine supply is exhausted. If there are vaccines left after all of priority group \\#1 is taken care of, then priority group \\#2 can be vaccinated and so on. "
