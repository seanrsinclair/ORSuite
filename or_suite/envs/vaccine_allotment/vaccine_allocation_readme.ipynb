This is represented in `vacc_alloc_4groups.py` as $A =\\{0, 1, 2, ..., 24\\}$, where each number maps to a particular action. An action in this space is choosing a priority order. A valid priority order is either (1) no priority order, aka vaccinate susceptible people in the population randomly, or (2) a permuation of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. In the file, an action is represented by a number $i \\in A$ where the corresponding action is at index $i$ of the list `all_priority_orders`. 0 corresponds to \\[ \\], which means no priority order.
